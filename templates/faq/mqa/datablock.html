<h2>QA with Measurement - Misc 1</h2>
<h3>MQA FAQ</h3>
<hr>

We have <a href="/mqarules/meas_qa" target="_blank">a series of application
    notes</a>, that talks about how to run MQA projects when measurement data is involved.
<br/><br/>

The key is to find the MQA recognizable
<mark>datablock</mark> name and
<mark>input/output variable</mark> names from the measurement data; we talked about how to let MQA auto-generate them in
<a href="/mqafaq/meas1" target="_blank">Chapter one of this
    series</a> through GUI, where we may have noticed that “#Measurement Rule Auto-Generated by Listmd” is marked at the beginning of the Rule, as highlighted in pink below.

Well, “listmd” is an executable locates in $MQAHOME/bin folder, as shown below.

In this note, we will explain how to simply run the “listmd” command to fetch all the information we need for generating a valid measurement Rule. It could be faster than going through the GUI Wizard steps if one prefers to command mode.


The “listmd” command will examine the measurement data files, and output all the information.<br/><br/>

As follows:<br/><br/>
Step 1, locate where our measurement data files are, and copy the path.

Step 2, in the terminal window, run the “listmd” command, and provide the path to it and hit Enter. It then scans all the files in that directory and generates report.

Step 3, we shall see a file named as “meamdt.txt” got created in the same folder, as shown below.

<br/><img src="/static/faq/mqa/datablock/4.png" border="1px"><br/><br/>

Now, open the “meamdt.txt”, we will find all the information, the following screenshot displays the mapping between this output and the measurement Rule.

Alright, now we know a bit more of how MQA deals with measurement data under the hood, happy Ruling~

Thank you!<br/>

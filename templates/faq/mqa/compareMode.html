<h2>Compare Mode</h2>
<hr>

When we create a Compare Project in MQA, we have this CompareMode option in the Project settings window, right above where
we specify the rule index file. As shown below:

<br/>
<br/>

It has 3 options, 0, 1 and 2, as explained below:
<ul>
    <li>0: Model A and B use the same constants from Model A.</li>
    <li>1: Model A and B use their own Bias settings, but use Aâ€™s Geometry (default).</li>
    <li>2: Model A and B use their own Bias and Geometry.</li>

</ul>

The picture below shows Bias and Geometry constant table, each model has its own, and Model A is the first model on the
selected list which is done as the first step when creating a Compare Project.
<br/><br/>
When compare 2 processes that have different Lmin/Wmin, etc, please use CompareMode=2.

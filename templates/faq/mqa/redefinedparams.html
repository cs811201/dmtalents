<h2>'redefinedparams' Error in Spectre Simulation</h2>
<hr>

If we ran into the following error during Spectre simulation, that complains about redefined parameters, here is the
workaround without trying to find and remove the redefined parameters.<br/><br/>

When we see the following error message in the .lis file after running Spectre simultion:
<pre>
Error found by spectre during circuit read-in.
    ERROR (SFE-59): "qaac72845.sp" 6: Parameter <font style="color:red">'some_param_name'</font>  was previously defined.
    Please try to add `+spice' in command line or
        option <font style="color:blue">'redefinedparams'</font>  in netlist to avoid these type of errors.

</pre>
In the above example, these error messages are found from a file called "qaac72845.lis", that is the simulation output file related to "qaac72845.sp", all these netlist input/outout files
are saved to every project's folder.
<br/><br/>

And, by looking through Spectre's user manual, we found the following explanation about <font style="color:blue">'redefinedparams'</font>.
<br/>

<pre>
redefinedparams=error -- Error message which halts the simulation (default)
redefinedparams=warning -- Warning message only
redefinedparams=ignore -- Spectre silently supports it.

</pre>

Looks like <font
        style="color:blue">redefinedparams</font> has 3 options, and defaults to error, thatâ€™s why we see these errors
that prevent us from running simulation successfully.
<br/><br/>

So, the workaround is to declare it to be ignored, by using the following option statement in the netlist:
<pre>
myOptions options redefinedparams=ignore

</pre>
And, in order to insert such an option statement in MQA's auto-generated netlist file, we just need to do the following,
as shown below:<br/>
<img src="/static/faq/mqa/redefinedparams/1.png" border="1px"><br/><br/>

The text inserted in these boxes on the GUI when we set every model, will be literally inserted to the netlist later on. And, we have flexibility between:
"inserted after model" and "inserted before model", they determine whether to inserted before/after the ".include" statement for the main model path.

As shown below:
<br/><br/>

The text here can really be anything besides Simulation options, since they are literally inserted.

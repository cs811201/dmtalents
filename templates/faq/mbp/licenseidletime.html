<h2>License Idle Time Options</h2>
<h3>MBP FAQ</h3>
<hr>

As far as MBP's license is concerned, MBP comes with the feature to auto release(check in) licenses if one session of MBP is in idle for a certain period of time, so that another user can then open(check out) MBP as soon as a license is available.
<br/><br/>
As shown below, go to menu "Tool - Preferences", we can find the License Options.

<ul>
    <li>GUI License Idle Time(in minutes) is the core license.
    </li>
    <li>Normal License Idle Time(in minutes) refers to any advanced feature such as BSIMCMG, HiSIM_HV, etc that are not
        included in
        the core.
    </li>

</ul>

<br/><br/>
More, let's say we have MBP session A idled for a while and lost license, MBP session B took it. Then, when the session A user comes back, and clicks on MBP GUI, MBP(A) will try to obtain a license, if not available, MBP(A) will provide one last option to save the project before forcefully close itâ€¦ anyhow, it's highly recommended that users to regularly save the work in MBP before he/she has to leave.

Thanks!

<h2>Adjust Recent Opened File List</h2>
<h3>ICCAP FAQ</h3>
<hr>

As shown below, ICCAP by default saves 5 recent opened model files in the Main windowâ€™s File menu.

<br/><img src="/static/faq/iccap/recentfilelist/1.png"/><br/><br/>
We can use an option called ICCAP_NUM_RECENT_FILES to adjust/increase the number of files, for example:
<ul>
    ICCAP_NUM_RECENT_FILES=10

</ul>
<br/>
This option must be appended in the $HOME/hpeesof/config/iccap.cfg file, as shown below on line 2.
<br/>
Please manually create this directory/file, if it didn't exist.

Then,  re-start ICCAP, and as we continue to open model files, we will eventually see up to 10 model files, as shown below. <br/>

We can further tune up the number, say ICCAP_NUM_RECENT_FILES=20, but a long list may cause trouble for display, 10 to 15 usually sounds a good choice.
<br/><br/>

Furthermore, we can use another option called ICCAP_MAX_RECENT_CHARS to control the width of the menu pick(s) for recent files, the default width is 40 characters. For example, if we set ICCAP_MAX_RECENT_CHARS=80, we will see wider(more complete) file paths, as shown below.

So, as we can see, ICCAP_NUM_RECENT_FILES and ICCAP_MAX_RECENT_CHARS often go together for a better view of history list.

<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Thanks!

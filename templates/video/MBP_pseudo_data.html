<h2>MBP FAQ</h2>

<h3>Generate Pseudo Data</h3>
<hr>
Why pseudo data? <br/><br/>
<ol>1. sometimes we got a model card but no measured data, how can we quickly check out the modelâ€™s performance in
    MBP.
</ol>
<ol>2. we may just have some measured data, say drain current Id, but we want to also see gate/substrate current, or CV
    simulation. this would be the right time to generate some pseudo data from MBP.
</ol>
<ol>3. to share simulated data with others without sending your real silicon data. enabled communication as well as IP
    protection.
</ol>

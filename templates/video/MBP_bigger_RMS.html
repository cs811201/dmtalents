<h2>MBP FAQ</h2>

<h3>How come the RMS became larger after Optimization</h3>
<hr>
Well, this is a common error we made, the reason is because incidentally we had another region selected from another
plot which may be hidden from current view.
<br/><br/>
A good habit we recommend to everyone, is, before every manual optimization, please use the Clear all regions button to clear all possible existing selection.

<h2>MBP Demo</h2>

<h3>View IV curves across Temperatures</h3>
<hr>
In this video, we will introduce how to view temperature dependent plot for IV curves in MBP.<br/>
We know MBP has plenty of built-in T-dependent plots for IMV targets, such as Vth vs. T, Idsat vs. T, etc.
<br/><br/>
Now the question is , how to view a I_V_T plot, such as Ids_Vgs @ different Temperature?

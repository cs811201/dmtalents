<h2>MQA Python Post Process</h2>
<h3>Multi-Processing/Threading</h3>
<hr/>
Python comes with both multi-processor, and multi-threading capabilities, and both help improve the performance and reduce execution time; however, because our case mainly comes down to using computational powers, itâ€™s better to run multi-processor than multi-threading.
<br/><br/>
In order to best utilize our multi-processors, we could divide large pieces of functions into multiple smaller chunks/functions, then submit them to the multi-processor pool.
<br/><br/>
The update <a href="/mqa/ppp/y_mp/download" target="_blank">IV_Targers_more_mp.py</a> file can be downloaded here.
<br/>
With my 6 core Intel CPU, the multi-processor finished all in 11 seconds, which is 3X speed-up compared to running everything in series.
<br/><br/>
For example:<br/>
<pre>
import concurrent.futures

with concurrent.futures.<font color="red">ProcessPoolExecutor()</font>  as ex:
    ex.submit(getTargetsFromIdVg)
    ex.submit(getTargetsFromIdVd)
    ex.submit(getSelfGain)
    ex.submit(getTargetsFromY)
    ex.submit(getGdsFromIdVd)
    ex.submit(getGds2FromIdVd)
    ex.submit(getGm2FromIdVg)
    ex.submit(getGmFromIdVg)

</pre>

<br/>
Note: if we were to use multi-threading, it finished at 28 seconds, which is not optimal in this case.
<br/><br/>
As shown below:<br/>
<pre>
import concurrent.futures

with concurrent.futures.<font color="blue">ThreadPoolExecutor()</font>  as ex:
    ex.submit(getTargetsFromIdVg)
    ex.submit(getTargetsFromIdVd)
    ex.submit(getSelfGain)
    ex.submit(getTargetsFromY)
    ex.submit(getGdsFromIdVd)
    ex.submit(getGds2FromIdVd)
    ex.submit(getGm2FromIdVg)
    ex.submit(getGmFromIdVg)

</pre>

Thank you!
